Project on the Evolution of Cyber Security


Timeline Showcasing the Evolution of Cybersecurity
1950s–1970s: The Foundations of Cybersecurity
1950s: Early computing systems were isolated, with no need for cybersecurity.
1960s: The rise of ARPANET (precursor to the internet) led to concerns about unauthorized access.
1971: The first known virus, "Creeper," was created as an experimental self-replicating program.
1972: "Reaper" was developed, becoming the first known antivirus program.
1977: The RSA encryption algorithm was introduced, enabling secure digital communication.

Lesson Leant
I learnt that the foundation of Cybersecurity started way back in Early 1950s
Also learnt that the first virus(Creeper) was created as self self-experimental self-replicating program while in 1972 “ Reaper” was developed becoming the first antivirus program

1980s: The Birth of Cyber Threats and Security Measures
1983: The term "computer virus" was coined by Fred Cohen.
1986: The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) was enacted in the U.S. to combat cybercrime.
1988: The Morris Worm became the first major worm to spread across the internet, leading to the creation of the CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team).
Lesson Leant
I learnt that computer virus was coined by Fred Cohen
The creation of worm in 1988 by Morris worm.


1990s: The Rise of Malware and Security Industry
1991: The first version of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption software was released.
1995: Firewalls became widely used to protect networks.
1999: The Melissa Virus spread via email, demonstrating the growing cyber threats.
2000s: Cybercrime Becomes a Major Threat
2000: The ILOVEYOU worm infected millions of computers via email.
2001: The Code Red and Nimda worms exploited vulnerabilities in Windows systems.
2003: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security created the National Cyber Security Division (NCSD).
2004: The first phishing attack was reported.
2007: The Storm Worm spread globally, turning infected computers into botnets.
2010s: Advanced Threats and Global Cybersecurity
2010: The Stuxnet worm targeted industrial systems, showing cyber warfare potential.
2013: The Yahoo data breach affected 3 billion accounts.
2014: The Sony Pictures hack raised concerns about state-sponsored cyberattacks.
2016: The Mirai botnet caused massive internet outages by exploiting IoT devices.
2017: WannaCry ransomware spread globally, affecting major organizations.
2020s–Present: AI, Ransomware, and Evolving Threats
2020: The COVID-19 pandemic led to increased cyberattacks targeting remote workers.
2021: The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack disrupted fuel supply in the U.S.
2022: The rise of zero-trust security models became a major focus for enterprises.
2023: AI-driven cybersecurity threats increased, leading to stronger machine learning-based defenses.
